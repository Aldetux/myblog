# About Me

Hi there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I’m Alexander,a "young" man trying to figure out this whole life thing. I’m a passionate IT professional, a father, and a husband. I’m on a journey finding balance between work, family, and personal health and this site is where I’ll be sharing my thoughts on all of that and more.


## A Little About Me

I grew up in a small rural village in Belgium, coming from a working-class family with two sisters. My journey has been anything but straightforward. I started out studying IT, switched to psychology in university searching for answers about life, and eventually found my way back to IT through self-teaching. I've worked in HR, and now I’m back in the tech world, where my passion truly lies.


## Why I Started This Blog

I started this blog for several reasons:

- **An Outlet and Practice Ground:** Writing has always been something I wanted to do more of. This blog is my practice ground, a place to put my thoughts into words, and a way to get better at it.
- **Accountability:** By sharing my journey here, I’m hoping to stay accountable. It’s easier to stick to your goals when you know others are watching.
- **Inspiration for Others:** I hope to inspire other people who are also trying to figure out this whole life thing. It’s not easy, and no one has all the answers, but we can learn from each other.

## What You’ll Find Here

 You’ll find posts about tech, fatherhood, health, and the occasional philosophical musing on life. It’s a mixed bag, but so is life, right?


## The Future of This Blog

Honestly, I’m still figuring out what this blog will become, just like I’m figuring out fatherhood and life. But that’s part of the journey, and I’m excited to see where it goes.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you.
